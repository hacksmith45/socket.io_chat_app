Socket.io is a tool that enables bi-directional communication between the client and the server.
There is this constant socket that enables realtime bi-directional event-based communication between
the server and the client so that both the server and the client can send messages instantly between themselves
so that if the state of the database changes or something in the server changes the client can know immediately
without needing to pull the server

-socket server
-socket client

Note:every client that connects to the server has their own socket instance

Socket.io works based on this event based communication technology 
-you can send a message from the client to the server to listen to an event
-you can also send a message from the server to the client to listen to an event 



socket.emit('message', "this is a test");

// sending to all clients, include sender
io.emit('message', "this is a test");

// sending to all clients except sender
socket.broadcast.emit('message', "this is a test");

// sending to all clients in 'game' room(channel) except sender
socket.broadcast.to('game').emit('message', 'nice game');

// sending to all clients in 'game' room(channel), include sender
io.in('game').emit('message', 'cool game');

// sending to sender client, only if they are in 'game' room(channel)
socket.to('game').emit('message', 'enjoy the game');

// sending to individual socketid
socket.broadcast.to(socketid).emit('message', 'for your eyes only');
